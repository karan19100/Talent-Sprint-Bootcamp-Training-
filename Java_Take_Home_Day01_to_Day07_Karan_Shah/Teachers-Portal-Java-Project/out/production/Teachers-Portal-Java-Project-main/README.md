## About

For our semester project we have decided to design a console based **Teachersâ€™ Portal System** 
using Eclipse (IDE for java). 
This project aims at creating a portal for teachers where they can 
sign into their accounts using their respective assigned Usernames and Passwords, incorrect or 
invalid username or password will prompt the user to again sign in, consecutive 4 wrong 
attempts will lead to permanent block for the account. 

Once logged in to their account, teacher will have access to the following options:

- Inserting Marks for the following:

        1. Quizzes.
        2. Mid Term Examination.
        3. Terminal Examination.
-  Inserting Attendance Status for the following:

        1. Class Attendance.
        2. Lab Attendance.
-  Viewing Marks for the following:

        1. Quizzes.
        2. Mid Term Examination.
        3. Terminal Examination.
-  Viewing Attendance for the following:

        1. Class Attendance.
        2. Lab Attendance.

After performing the desired actions, the user will then get the option to **log out** of their portal.
